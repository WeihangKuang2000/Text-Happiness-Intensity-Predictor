# Text Happiness Intensity Predictor
This is a implementation of a simple linear neural network that reads in text and uses pretrained embeddings to predict the **happiness intensity** of the text.
It fit the network weights using the analytic expression we discussed in class.

For this implementation I will use the functionality of PyTorch, HuggingFace "transformers" library for getting pretrained models, "pandas" for data loading, matplotlib for visualization.

There are two .txt files use in this implementation, you'll have to make them available locally or upload them to your colab instance.
